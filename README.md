# SFM
A Soccer-(Player-)Factor-Model to evaluate the skill/ability of soccer players.
The SFM can be applied to a variety of regression and classification problems.


## Part 1
It's first application is in the form of a Bayesian Logistic Regression model that tries to explain the probability of a player scoring a goal, by the player’s own skill/ ability — the player’s ‘alpha’ in the finance-jargon — and his team’s strength.
