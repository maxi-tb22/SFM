In this folder you find the redacted & unredacted version of the Soccer-Factor-Model (SFM). 

The redacted version might serve as a tool to learn how to implement a Bayesian Logistic Regression in python with PyMC.
The redacted version includes several tasks -- with hints, which may help or not ... -- asking you to code yourself.
The unredacted version then serves as a tentative solution, to which you can compare your own specification -- and hopefully achieve better results than I did!


You can also find the recording of the PyMCon seminar (July, 17th 2023), in which I discussed this very notebook, via the following link: https://pymcon.com/events/

Enjoy the game!
